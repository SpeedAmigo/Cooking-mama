  - You used to bring these colors to life.
  - Even the dull ones glowed in your hands.
  - 'Now

    they just sit there, waiting... like me.'
  - 'The room feels gray without you in it, even with all

    your paints still
    here.'
  - 'Sometimes I wonder... If you had stayed, would I still feel

    anything?'
  - 'Or did you take everything good with you? I try to be strong, but most days
    I

    just sit, stare.'
  - Like those brushes. What am I supposed to do with all this emptiness?
