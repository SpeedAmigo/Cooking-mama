  - 'I keep expecting to hear your footsteps in the hall... that hummed tune you
    always

    sang when you made coffee.'

  - Just a few days ago. I still feel your arm around me when I wake up.
  - 'I still leave space

    for you in bed, without thinking.'
  - "Maybe... maybe this is just a bad dream. Maybe\r\ntomorrow I'll wake up and
    you\u2019ll be here, making dumb jokes and warming up\r\nleftovers."
  - "You can\u2019t be gone, Ezra. You can\u2019t."
