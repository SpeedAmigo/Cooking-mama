  - "You always used to say I looked best when I didn\u2019t know the camera was
    there."
  - 'And I

    laughed, because you were always there, behind the lens, smiling
    at me like I was the

    only thing worth taking pictures of.'
  - 'Now all I see is less and less of you - just your

    hand, a reflection,
    a corner of your shirt.'
  - "I keep flipping through these pictures, hoping\r\none more might show your face,
    your eyes... but they\u2019re fading."
  - "I\u2019d give anything for\r\none more photo."
  - "Just one where you\u2019re laughing again."
  - Just one more day. Please.
